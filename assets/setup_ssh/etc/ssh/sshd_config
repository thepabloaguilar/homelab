# This configuration was made based on the "OpenSSH server - Configuration - Modern" section
# from here: https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh.html
# Some adjustments were introduced based on feedbacks from https://www.sshaudit.com, there's
# a note in the places I have modified explaining the reasoning.

# Supported HostKey algorithms by order of preference.
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

# The following key is disabled because a possibly back door in it, more information:

#
# The feedback from sshaudit is:
# NIST P-curves are possibly back-doored by the U.S. National Security Agency.
# HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

# Password based logins are disabled - only public key based logins are allowed.
# TODO!: UNCOMMENT THIS TO NO WHEN EVERYTHING IS WORKING PROPERLY
# AuthenticationMethods publickey

# LogLevel VERBOSE logs user's key fingerprint on login. Needed to have a clear audit track of which key was using to log in.
LogLevel VERBOSE

# Log sftp level file access (read/write/etc.) that would not be easily logged otherwise.
Subsystem sftp  /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server -f AUTHPRIV -l INFO

# Root login is not allowed for auditing reasons. This is because it's difficult to track which process belongs to which root user:
#
# On Linux, user sessions are tracking using a kernel-side session id, however, this session id is not recorded by OpenSSH.
# Additionally, only tools such as systemd and auditd record the process session id.
# On other OSes, the user session id is not necessarily recorded at all kernel-side.
# Using regular users in combination with /bin/su or /usr/bin/sudo ensure a clear audit track.
# PermitRootLogin No
# TODO!: CHANGE THIS TO NO WHEN EVERYTHING IS WORKING PROPERLY
PermitRootLogin yes
